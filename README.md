<p><span style="color: #808080;">Villagers #1</span>: Hmmph! Had you heard the rumor say there is a portal open up everywhere in our worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Villagers #2</span>: Yea!&nbsp;Hmmph! I don't believe it at first, but after I saw a strange monster showing up in the forest near our village.&nbsp;Hmmph! I'm starting to believe it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Villagers #1</span>: Of course it truth! Hmmph! I think that monster appears because of that portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Villagers #2</span>: well! I think our world is about to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Steve: Whaaaa! What a lovely day. I like this new world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Alex:&nbsp;Huh! But it rains when we just spawn in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Steve:&nbsp;It's the weather that is just bad. But the days will always be great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Alex: I hope it is like what you said though. But since we just spawn in and we don't have any tools also it rains now and... there are mobs <span style="color: #ff0000;">Everywhere!</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Alex: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Run!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

They manage to start to progress and gather some resources, they also come across a lava pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Steve: Hey! Alex! wanna make a nether portal?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Alex: Right now? But we just started. You are always impulsive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Steve: Come on, it's just the nether. We have been there before. It's not that dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Alex: Alright, do whatever you want. Here take this water bucket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Steve: Sweet! Here we go... done!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Narrator</span><span style="color: #000000;">:</span> <span style="color: #000000;">They all go in the portal. But they make a mistake. That mistake will make them realize. They should have been more prepared. Because both of them didn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Steve/Alex</span>: <span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT THE HELL GOING ON IN THIS WORLD!
